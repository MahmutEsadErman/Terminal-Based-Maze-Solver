# Terminal-Based-Maze-Solver
This program generates random mazes then it solves by looking all possible ways. What differs this program from others is that every run it improves. Each time a maze solved, the best solution is saved and in the next runs in each point, it looks which direction is more prone to solve the maze and moves accordingly. All the code is implemented in cpp.
